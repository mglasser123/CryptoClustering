# CryptoClustering

One challenging aspect of this assignment was that when I looked at the elbow curves, 4 clusters seemed to be the optimal amount on both the pca and non pca analysis. That obviously is not correct, but I am not sure what I did wrong. All work is my own and I used the starter code provided in class.
